# React (with hooks)

An implementation of The Slider Test with React. This version uses function components with hooks. 

## Implementation notes

* We use Parcel for bundling
* CSS is defined externally, and bundled in an external CSS file
* The demo does not include performance optimizations (e.g. `useCallback`)
