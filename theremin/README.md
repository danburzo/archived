# Theremin

A Theremin built for the Macbook Touch Bar, using [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar) and [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js).

## Setting up

Clone this repository and run `npm install` to fetch all the dependencies.

Start it up with:

```bash
# using npm
npm run start

# using yarn
yarn start
```

## Notes

This is a quick, should-be-sleeping-instead hack, so it's pretty much a work in progress. I couldn't figure out why the sound starts playing only after the second time you open the app from the menu bar, so for now you'll have to click it twice to get it to work :-)
